# Production Readiness Checklist

## 🚨 Critical Security Issues

- [ ] **No Authentication System** - Anyone can create/modify projects
- [ ] **No Rate Limiting** - Vulnerable to abuse and DDoS attacks
- [ ] **Manual SSL Management** - Risk of certificate expiry
- [ ] **No Input Validation** - Potential security vulnerabilities

## ⚡ Quick Improvement Suggestions

### 1. SSL Certificate Auto-Renewal ⏰

- Set up automated certificate renewal with cron jobs
- Add monitoring for certificate expiry (30-day alerts)
- Implement backup and recovery for certificates

### 2. Rate Limiting Implementation 🛡️

- Add API-level rate limiting (10 req/min per IP)
- Implement stricter limits for domain operations (5/hour)
- Configure Nginx-level request throttling

### 3. Domain Verification Scheduling 🔄

- Schedule hourly verification attempts for pending domains
- Add daily health checks for verified domains
- Implement automatic cleanup of expired configurations

### 4. Enhanced Monitoring 📊

- Monitor certificate expiry dates
- Track domain verification success/failure rates
- Add performance metrics and error rate tracking
- Set up uptime monitoring for custom domains

### 5. Authentication & Authorization 🔐

- Implement JWT-based API authentication
- Add user management and role-based access
- Generate API keys for programmatic access
- Ensure proper tenant isolation
